# Simulation of Blockchain-based PPRL

This repository contains a simplified version of the solution originally available at http://github.com/thiagonobrega/auditable_pprl/. In this version, we created a simulation to execution of the original protocol, which requires several architectural components, such as i) configuration of a Blockchain network, ii) deployment of Smart Contracts, iii) creation of multiple web services.


## Re-run the experiments

In this repository, we created a simulation of the original protocol to facilitate the assessment of protocol characteristics - e.g., privacy.

All of the steps are exposed in a [python/sim_bbpprl.ipynb](Jupyter notebook).
